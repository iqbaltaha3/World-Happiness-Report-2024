# World-Happiness-Report-2024

# The focus of the 2024 World Happiness Report shifts towards examining the happiness experienced by individuals across different stages of life. Contrary to Shakespeare's portrayal of later life stages as inherently dismal in "As You Like It," contemporary happiness research reveals a more nuanced perspective, one that evolves over time.

# Initiated by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, the World Happiness Report offers insights into national happiness levels, derived from self-assessment ratings provided by respondents. These ratings are then correlated with various indicators of life quality. Notably, Finland has secured the title of the world's happiest country for seven consecutive years, according to the report's findings.

# Drawing extensively from data sourced through the Gallup World Poll, each annual report is publicly accessible through the World Happiness Report website, facilitating widespread dissemination and engagement with its findings.
